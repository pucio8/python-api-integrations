## Setup and Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd [PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME]
    ```
2.  **Create an Environment File:**
This application requires an environment file to store your private API key.
Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add the following line, replacing `your_api_key_here` with your actual key from OpenWeatherMap:

    ```
    WEATHER_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

- Go to the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) website and create a free account.
- Navigate to the "API keys" tab in your user dashboard.
- You will find a default API key already generated for you. Copy this key.

Important: The `.env` file contains private keys. Never commit it to GitHub. Make sure your .gitignore file includes an entry for `.env`.

    ```bash
    # .gitignore
    .env
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file containing `requests` and `python-dotenv`)*

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Example Usage

After running the script, you will see the following output in your console:

```bash
Temperature in Krapkowice is 18Â°C
```

*(The city and temperature will vary based on the code and current weather conditions.)*
